While studying React I started this small project to practice Component creation, usage of State and other basic concepts.
My aim is not perfection or not even creating a "good" user experiance I just want it to be good enough on the UI front.
Furthermore currently I don't plan on diving deep in functionality or offering multiple options for the user while clearly there is a lot of potentially exciting and challenging problems to solve with the implementation of serching for triplet cards instead of pairs or generating fully flexible and responsive UI for example.
